# SpaceMapping
--------------
Idiot version of what a roomba does, in regard to mapping the space it might find itself in.
A robot is placed within a space and at the least, map out the space.

## Rules
---------
- There may be obstacles of varying shapes within the space
- The space may or may not be a square or rectangle
- The unit has no awareness of distant tiles except the one it is currently on
- The space may not be traversed diagonally (maybe i'll change this later)
- Performance is not an immediate concern, only accuracy and completeness
- The unit will be placed randomly within the space
